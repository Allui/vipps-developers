# Postman

[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) is a common tool for working with REST APIs.
We offer [Postman Collections](https://www.getpostman.com/collection) for some APIs.
Postman can import Swagger files directly, so collections is not a requirement.

With Postman you can make calls to all the API endpoints and see the full
request and response for each call, including headers.

When contacting us about API issues, we are usually able to help faster if you send us
the complete request and response.

See the [Postman documentation](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/) for more information about using Postman.

# Example code

We have made some example code available, in hope that it may be useful: 
https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers/tree/master/code-examples

# The Vipps test environment (MT)

The Merchant Test Environment (MT) is available for all Vipps customers.

The environment is suitable for testing _most_ of the Vipps functionality, but some
functionality in the production environment is not available in MT.
In general, MT does not contain functionality that requires integration with
third parties, such as Payment Service Providers, EVRY, Nets, banks, etc.

Functionality not available in MT (a non-exhaustive list):
* Push alerts may be unstable
* Payment of invoices, both for Vipps Regninger and Vipps Faktura
* Limited support for testing card statuses that require connections to Nets, etc
* Limited support for looking up customer information in [KAR](https://www.bits.no/en/bank/konto-og-adresseringsregister-kar/), etc

To test functionality that is not available in MT, you will have to use the
production environment in a controlled manner. One example may be to test
Vipps Regninger with real invoices, but with small amounts. We recommend 2 NOK.

Other differences in MT:
* We allow 10,000 incorrect PIN attempts before locking the Vipps user's account

### Test users

The welcome email contains information about your test user, which has the following dummy data:

* Name
* Phone number
* PIN
* Bank account number
* Credit card number

You can use this test user to in the [Vipps test apps](#vipps-test-apps).

If you need additional payment cards, you can add it in the Vipps app. 
See [Credit card numbers](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers/tree/master/testdata#credit-card-numbers) 
for more details.

See also: [Vipps Test Data](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers/blob/master/testdata/README.md).

# Vipps test apps

The test apps are identical to the production app, but connects to the
Vipps [the Vipps test environment (MT)](#the-vipps-test-environment-mt) instead of the production environment.

## iOS

From the instructions in the link above:

> Installing a Beta iOS App from an Invitation Email or Public Link:

> 2. Open your invitation email or tap on the [public link](https://testflight.apple.com/join/hTAYrwea) on your iOS device.
> 3. Tap View in TestFlight or Start Testing; or tap Accept, Install, or Update for the app you want to test.

# Vipps design guidelines

Guidelines, logos, buttons, etc: https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-design-guidelines

# Vipps repositories on GitHub

To clone [all the Vipps repositories](https://github.com/vippsas), this works for macOS:

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), the missing package manager for macOS  
        ```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
        ```
2. Install [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/), a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor  
        ```
brew install jq
       ```
3. Run this command  
        ```
curl -s https://api.github.com/orgs/vippsas/repos | jq .[].clone_url | xargs -n 1 git clone
        ```

## Pull all GitHub repositories in the current directory

Creating an alias like `gitall` for this command may be useful:

```
find . -type d -depth 1 -exec git --git-dir={}/.git --work-tree=$PWD/{} pull origin master \;
```
