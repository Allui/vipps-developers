## Vipps API servers

* Test (MT): apitest.vipps.no
* Production: api.vipps.no

**Please note:** Vipps may change the IP addresses for the API servers. To ensure
that you are whitelisting the correct IP addresses please use these hostnames
and DNS, and automatically update your firewall rules if there are DNS changes.

## Vipps request servers

Requests made by Vipps are made from the servers specified below.
Vipps normally only uses one server at a time, and change servers approximately
every three months.

| Production (Prod)   | Disaster recovery (DR) | Test (MT)              |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| callback-1.vipps.no | callback-dr-1.vipps.no | callback-mt-1.vipps.no |
| callback-2.vipps.no | callback-dr-2.vipps.no | callback-mt-2.vipps.no |
| callback-3.vipps.no | callback-dr-3.vipps.no | callback-mt-3.vipps.no |
| callback-4.vipps.no | callback-dr-4.vipps.no | callback-mt-4.vipps.no |

The disaster recovery environment is as important as the production environment.

**Please note:** Vipps may change the IP addresses for the request servers. To ensure
that you are whitelisting the correct IP addresses please use these hostnames
and DNS, and automatically update your firewall rules if there are DNS changes.

For API products where Vipps makes requests to your servers, please make sure
that these request servers are allowed through firewalls, etc.
