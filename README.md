# Vipps repositories on GitHub

To clone all the Vipps repos, this works for macOS:

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), the missing package manager for macOS  
        ```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
        ```
2. Install [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/), a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor  
        ```
brew install jq
       ```
3. Run this command  
        ```
curl -s https://api.github.com/orgs/vippsas/repos | jq .[].clone_url | xargs -n 1 git clone
        ```

## Pull all GitHub repos in the current directory

Creating an alias like `gitall` for this command may be useful:

```
find . -type d -depth 1 -exec git --git-dir={}/.git --work-tree=$PWD/{} pull origin master \;
```
# Postman

[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) is a common tool for working with REST APIs.
We offer [Postman Collections](https://www.getpostman.com/collection) for some APIs.

With Postman you can make calls to all the API endpoints and see the full
`request` and `response` for each call, including headers.

Postman can import Swagger files directly, so collections is not a requirement.

See the [Postman documentation](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/) for more information about using Postman.

# Vipps test app

# iOS

The iOS test app is available in Apple TestFlight: https://testflight.apple.com/join/hTAYrwea

The app is identical to the production app, but connects to the Vipps test environment (MT: Merchant Test) instead of the production environment.

To get your own test users created in the MT environment, please [contact us](contact.md). We will need the following:
* Phone number, 8 digits (Norwegian numbers only)
* SSN (f√∏dselsnummer), 11 digits
* First name and last name
* Account number

# Android

We are working on a test app for Android, and will update this page when it is available.
