# Requirements for foreign companies

Vipps has some requirements that your company must fulfill in order to use Vipps as a payment provider and to receive payments:
* A Norwegian organization number
* A Norwegian bank account
* An appointed contact person with a Norwegian phone and identity number

Vipps payments can only be made by customers with a Norwegian phone number and with a Norwegian national identity number or D-number (given to foreign persons who do not have a national identity number, but have a need for identification with the Norwegian authorities).
Read more on how to [apply](https://www.skatteetaten.no/en/person/foreign/norwegian-identification-number/) for a D-number.
