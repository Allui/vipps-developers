Hi

Vipps does not yet have a solution for Shopify.

We are seeing a lot of interest for Shopify, and we would like to offer a solution.
Vipps has open source plugins for
WooCommerce (https://www.vipps.no/bedrift/vipps-pa-nett/woocommerce) and
Magento (https://www.vipps.no/bedrift/vipps-pa-nett/magento).

See https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-shopify for the latest status

Until there is an official Vipps solution for Shopify, the best solution is to
use a PSP (paymenty service provider) that supports both Shopify and Vipps,
like Quickpay: https://quickpay.net/no/

The standard Vipps eCommerce API is available at
https://help.shopify.com/en/api/getting-started, and the Shopify API is
available at https://help.shopify.com/en/api/getting-started
