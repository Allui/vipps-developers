Hi

Vipps has a test environment called Merchant Test, or "MT" in short:
https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers#the-vipps-test-environment-mt

Vipps also have test apps for iOS (in TestFlight) and Android, which are
identical to the normal Vipps app, except that they have a different logo
and is connected to MT instead of the production environment. Details here:
https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers#vipps-test-apps

Please note that "app switching" is done with the same URL (vipps://) both for
the test and the production app. Who doing "app switch", iOS may therefore open
the test app instead of the production app. For development, we recommend to
only have the test app installed.
