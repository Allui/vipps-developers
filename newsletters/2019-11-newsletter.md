# Vipps eCom v1 API to be phased out June 1 2020

The Vipps eCom API v1 was superseded by the eCom v2 API around two years ago.
The eCom v2 API has all the functionality of eCom v1, and there is no reason
for not upgrading to eCom v2.

Se [more details about eCom v1](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-ecom-api/blob/master/v1-deprecation.md),
and
[more details about the various Vipps APIs](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers/blob/master/vipps-getting-started.md#api-products).
