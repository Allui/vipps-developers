sent to all email addresses in the original email.

## Automatic reply

You will get an auto-reply from us with an issue number like `VSD-12345` in the `Subject` line.
This is the unique number for this specific issue, and is used to connect all communication
about this issue in our systems.

The auto-reply is sent from a real e-mail address, which you can reply to ‚úåÔ∏è

### Adding additional information

If you want to send additional information about the same issue,
please reply to the email, without changing the `Subject` line.

Please remove previous communication when replying to an email, do _not_ quote
all the previous messages - we already have them.

## Response time

We will help as quickly as possible, but due to large variations in the number
of requests and the varying complexity of resolving them, we can not guarantee response times.

## More than one problem, or a new one?

Please send separate emails for each problem. If you send an email about a
new problem by replying to an old issue, it may delay our response.
